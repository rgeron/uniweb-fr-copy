## Objective : respect Digital Accessibility - Design Rules to Respect (RGAA 4.1.2)

- Achieve a compliance score >90% on an RGAA sample and anticipate post-2025 regulations
- Any new page or functionality must be validated by a minimal accessibility review
- Priority is given to blocking criteria: contrasts, keyboard navigation, alternative texts, heading structure

- Text/background contrast: minimum 4.5:1 (AA standard) for normal-sized text, and 3:1 for large text (>18px or ->14px bold)
- Information conveyed only by color is prohibited (e.g., "required fields in red")
- Use tested color palettes (colorblind, achromatopsia, etc.)

## Font and Text

- Use readable fonts (sans-serif, sufficient line spacing)
- Text must be able to be enlarged up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Provide a clear heading hierarchy: unique <h1>, then <h2>, <h3>, etc.
- No text should be presented as an image

## Images and Media
- All informative images must have relevant alternative text (alt)
- Decorative images must be ignored by screen readers (alt="")
- Videos must provide a transcript, or even synchronized subtitles if informative
- Provide an accessible alternative to audio-only content (transcription)

## Navigation and Keyboard

- Everything must be accessible by keyboard (without mouse)
- Logical tab order (natural or explicit tabindex)
- Avoid keyboard traps (unreachable or blocking elements)
- Presence of a skip link to main content (skip to content)

## Forms

- Each field must have a clear and visible label (even if there's a placeholder)
- Errors must be indicated textually, not just visually
- Field groups: use <fieldset> and <legend> tags

## Structure and HTML Semantics

- Use semantic tags: <header>, <main>, <footer>, <nav>
- No structure should rely exclusively on non-semantic CSS/JS (e.g., <div> instead of <button>)
- HTML code must be valid and well-structured (W3C validator)

## Footer and Header

- Footer must include: legal notices, accessibility policy, site map
- Presence of a link to the accessibility statement (even fictional in beta version)
- Site logo must link to the homepage

## Behaviors and Animations

- No rapid blinking (epileptic risk)
- Animations must be able to be disabled or limited (prefers-reduced-motion)
- No content should move automatically without explicit interaction

## Recommended Bonus (outside RGAA but useful)

- Integration of high contrast mode / text on dark background
- Possible integration of Hello Uniweb filter from the mockup phase
